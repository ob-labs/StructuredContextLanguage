## Step 0, config Otel, server

## Step 1 maybe client able to reg procedure in a service or FAAS(function as a service) way

# | Case number | File format | Context RAG | Memory | Function call | 
# | 0 | n/A | n/A | n/A | n/A |
## case 1 test with file format and context RAG
# | 1 | pdf | Autonomy(enable by default) | n/A | Autonomy |
## case 2 test with memory(relative case)
# | 2 | n/A | Autonomy(enable by default) | Autonomy | Autonomy | 
## todo here a feed back loop here to show the Autonomy of context RAG.

## case 3 test with memory(no relative case)
# | 3 | n/A | Autonomy(enable by default) | New Thread(Autonomy) | Autonomy | 
## case 4 test with hit
# | 4 | n/A | Autonomy(enable by default) | by config | Autonomy |
## case 5 test with context hit
# | 5 | n/A | by config | n/A | Autonomy |
## case 6 test with function call with hit
# | 6 | n/A | by config | n/A | by config |

## Get result from server
